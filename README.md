# My Voting System

## 📌 Project Overview

**My Voting System** is a web-based electronic voting application designed to manage elections digitally. The system provides a secure and transparent platform where administrators can create elections and manage candidates, while eligible voters can cast their votes online and view election results.

The project demonstrates core concepts of **web application development**, **user authentication**, and **data management**, making it suitable for academic use, demonstrations, and as a foundation for more advanced voting systems.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Digitize the traditional voting process
* Reduce manual errors in vote counting
* Ensure that each voter can vote only once
* Provide real-time and accurate election results
* Demonstrate practical implementation of a full-stack web application

## ✨ Key Features

* **Admin Management**

  * Create and manage elections
  * Add, edit, and remove candidates
  * Monitor voting progress and results

* **Voter Functionality**

  * Secure login and authentication
  * View available elections
  * Cast a vote (one vote per voter per election)

* **Results**

  * Automatic vote counting
  * Real-time display of election outcomes

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **JavaScript**
* **HTML & CSS**
* **Node.js** (if applicable)
* **Express / Backend logic** (if applicable)
* **Database** (as implemented in the project)

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

* Node.js
* npm (Node Package Manager)

### Steps
